1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,199
okay so uh hello everyone listening uh

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,920
this is obviously everscale incubator i

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,000
believe we're show number one

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,599
um i'm speaking today with norton uh who

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,920
is bringing his uh projects to us fido

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,080
safe so hi nilton uh good to have you

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,439
here do you want to introduce yourself

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,920
uh yeah sure and then thanks for

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,880
providing the stage for presenting my

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,840
project

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,399
actually cannot say much about myself

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,440
like an ordinary guy developer crypto

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,880
enthusiast

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,079
and

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,360
yes i'm like keeping an eye on the ever

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,840
scale

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,920
uh blockchain for a while but i didn't

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,640
have chance to find good

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,399
applicable uh cases that i can implement

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,120
but yes recently i have found the niche

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,160
that sounds interesting to me and today

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,319
i would like to

23
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,040
say a few words about this niche

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,840
describe their target audience

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,360
its pains its needs and share some

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,560
insights

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,600
and

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,799
yeah and actually uh like it

29
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,439
and it was the grounds for

30
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,560
the this product project uh

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,320
if it is safe that i i will also maybe

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,040
share during this podcast

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,680
okay well in which case uh i think we

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,439
should probably dive straight into it

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,799
and

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,360
there we go um that's the first i'm

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,720
doing a screen share on here

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,960
uh

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,360
where are we i believe it should be this

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
one

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,399
aha yes so uh can everyone see their

42
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
pitch there on the screen have i shared

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,159
the right screen

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,040
uh yeah i guess the wrong screen it is

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,640
the last question oh

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,640
there we go right oh yes god we've got

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,439
an infinite loop there i apologize guys

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,840
uh let's close that down

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,160
i'm more more used to uh working with

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,080
zoom here

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
yes me too and that's why i

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,160
didn't want to share

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,640
i thought you could have more yeah

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,879
yeah

55
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,879
there we go so

56
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,200
excellent can everyone see the uh pitch

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,720
we should see fido safe on the screen

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,319
yeah i do yeah okay excellent uh so

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,480
let's just quickly roll through this and

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,560
uh we won't go into every point on the

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,760
document because i've got a few

62
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,280
questions so we'll uh try and keep it a

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,280
little more informal

64
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,519
uh but yeah obviously

65
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,360
if you could give us just a very quick

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,760
uh high level overview of what is fine

67
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,000
find out safe

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,160
okay

69
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,800
just to warm up uh

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,640
would like to say a few words about the

71
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,680
name so the name originates from

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,080
actually latin and fido means the first

73
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,760
person

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,720
verb

75
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,480
like i trust

76
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,040
and like the save that i trust

77
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,200
firefighter safe but recently somebody

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,599
shared a reference that there is a

79
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,000
famous player chess player vladimir

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,599
putin

81
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,440
and yes

82
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,319
from that time every time i i'm here

83
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,159
pretty safe i think about yours

84
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,159
yeah honestly it's a very hot topic at

85
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,519
the moment with the uh world

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,799
championships of course yeah

87
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,280
yeah but basically in a nutshell uh this

88
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
is a service

89
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,440
web service where

90
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,200
actually people can

91
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,959
jointly manage their financial resources

92
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,720
so that we would have

93
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,280
multiple custodians using different

94
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,200
wallets who can

95
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,480
sign transactions

96
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,360
and perform some

97
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,159
operations as community as dao

98
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
yeah yeah and so uh touching into your

99
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,720
first kind of point here then uh who is

100
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,959
this product aimed at who who's going to

101
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,899
use fido safe

102
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,120
[Music]

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,238
yeah

104
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,000
it might sound surprising

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,840
that

106
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,280
actually

107
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,199
there are some

108
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,919
b2b tools around

109
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,360
uh on the market uh so not only

110
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,080
personal accounts use crypto nowadays

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,320
but also business accounts

112
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,199
uh

113
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,400
start penetrating the crypto surface

114
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,240
more and more and

115
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,199
of course market starts preparing some

116
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,479
tools for

117
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,680
catering to these accounts and that's

118
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,360
why

119
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,919
i can describe these companies as a

120
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,040
small

121
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
crypt

122
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,080
investment firms or maybe crypto brokers

123
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,039
uh

124
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,320
and possibly communities who also like

125
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
uh come together to make financial

126
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,639
decisions together

127
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,160
other audiences for the shared using all

128
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,199
the

129
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,199
accounts could be for example miners

130
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,520
or exchanges but

131
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,400
they are

132
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,360
i guess too big to fit the feed the safe

133
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,000
requirements so that i would just

134
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,240
like limit the

135
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,840
users to the small and medium crypto

136
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,240
businesses that we will call uh crypto

137
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
funds or crypto firms

138
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,120
okay so essentially blockchain centric

139
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,919
uh small and medium enterprises uh

140
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,240
enterprises and businesses which have to

141
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,039
you know follow a more formal path

142
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,960
yeah understanding yeah

143
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,360
okay excellent and so uh again this is a

144
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,000
very nicely laid out slide presentation

145
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,720
uh why is it that there's a need out

146
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,280
there why aren't there already products

147
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,400
which serve these people

148
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,520
yeah so

149
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,759
they

150
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,680
there are the tools

151
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,319
and their tools actually serve their

152
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,280
existing blockchains so that if one of

153
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,840
these companies would like to start

154
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,039
their operations on everscale

155
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,420
then they would need to

156
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,960
[Music]

157
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,720
kind of uh

158
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,540
adjust to uh

159
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,080
[Music]

160
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,840
also continue operations from here and

161
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,520
they could have

162
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,560
different options for this

163
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,319
is that coming from your background my

164
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,960
friend oh yes yes

165
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,360
that's okay that's okay i thought we had

166
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,720
someone bombing

167
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,680
no all good okay so as you say then uh

168
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,120
this is a solution which already exists

169
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,840
on other chains in other forms uh but

170
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,199
there is

171
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,520
well um obviously i'll let you explain

172
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,360
this side at this slide to yourself if

173
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,440
you want uh existing solutions

174
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,639
yeah

175
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,960
so so yes to prepare for this

176
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,599
presentation i checked the market

177
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,840
and

178
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,919
tried to find the tools that people use

179
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,800
and

180
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,479
try to investigate

181
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,039
which functionality is built into these

182
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,120
tools so that

183
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,520
here are my list that

184
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,840
like originated from the

185
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,599
first maybe two hours of searching uh

186
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,680
of course there are more solutions on

187
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,919
the market but these are the like

188
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,720
the prominent ones and uh

189
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,919
basing on these solutions i can

190
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,639
make some assumptions on what these

191
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,280
businesses actually require and the

192
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,039
functionality of these solutions

193
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,240
actually is pretty much the same

194
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,360
and so that like if we go to there maybe

195
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,400
maybe the second slide

196
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,120
that could help us we will

197
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
find out that

198
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,680
in the bare minimum it will require

199
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,759
three things actually first of all some

200
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,840
some tools for collective decision

201
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,000
making so that

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,640
like multiple custodians can

203
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,958
vote for this or that or against this or

204
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,320
that decision

205
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,880
then a user management facilities like

206
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,679
to the ability to assign roles

207
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,040
and to add more people remove people

208
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
from

209
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,519
uh

210
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,360
from uh the list of custodians and so i

211
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,480
mean like

212
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,959
onboarding and of boarding employees

213
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,480
actually right

214
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,600
and

215
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,320
so

216
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,600
i believe

217
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,680
if i've got the right tab here uh you

218
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,920
can kind of see an example uh so this is

219
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
actually the product doing that here i

220
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,240
believe you've added a custodian here as

221
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,839
an example transaction you showed me

222
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,480
earlier yeah yeah sure yeah there we go

223
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,800
so you can see that happening there

224
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,880
sorry carry on

225
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,600
yeah and

226
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,720
the the third right and

227
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
maybe the most tricky one is

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,800
uh

229
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,240
the auditing facilities like the ability

230
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,959
to see their historical log and be able

231
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,320
to understand

232
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,440
who did what and when

233
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
and

234
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,839
like

235
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,399
when i started with error everscale i

236
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,560
tried uh

237
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,959
a few multisig accounts

238
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,760
and actually uh

239
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,200
and none of them

240
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
had

241
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,640
open source code and but there were

242
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,120
compiled versions of these multisig

243
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,720
accounts and uh using these accounts it

244
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,680
it was really tricky to understand the

245
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,839
history of operations so

246
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,720
maybe it was something wrong with me but

247
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,560
uh like i feel total obscurity

248
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,800
so that was one of the reasons to

249
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
actually create something

250
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,079
where the transactions are obvious right

251
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,040
you can

252
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,560
at every moment uh glance it transaction

253
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
and see

254
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,640
its details like and

255
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,680
who actually confirmed or rejected it

256
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,240
and what was inside this transaction

257
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,800
what operation should happen

258
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,279
okay so uh essentially like just coming

259
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,160
to this part of the slide uh what you're

260
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,200
saying there are solutions which kind of

261
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,839
do the task that fido safe uh does but

262
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,399
yours will do it in a more refined

263
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,640
manner which is more suitable for like

264
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,160
you say the target audience you're

265
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,920
aiming for here

266
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
right understanding correctly

267
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,600
uh right so uh actually uh it is a

268
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,560
service and not a wallet so that users

269
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,640
are not obliged to

270
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,839
come to this new wallet and like operate

271
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,680
only in this wallet uh comparing to for

272
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,399
example oberton right when you need to

273
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,959
forcefully switch to this solution for

274
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,839
all your operations but instead it is a

275
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,240
web service uh that uses different

276
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,600
wallets for

277
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,040
a very very concrete purpose for

278
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,279
assigning multi-sig transactions and for

279
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,279
managing multiple transactions and for

280
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,640
managing these related operations so yes

281
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,600
uh

282
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
on the one hand

283
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,279
there are wallets

284
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,160
that can potentially implement the same

285
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,800
but it is not their specialization

286
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,760
they are like busy with other things

287
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
like implementing the boards

288
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,760
implementing true nft implementing other

289
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,560
features that their customers actually

290
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
require and

291
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,839
like

292
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,600
instead why would they like turn to some

293
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,480
other niche market and start doing

294
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,120
something different like it doesn't make

295
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,079
sense

296
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,600
yeah of course and

297
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,120
i understand that completely that makes

298
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
a lot of sense so obviously these uh

299
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,200
other solution providers they're

300
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,839
all not solution providers it is a it's

301
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,760
an option it's a feature of these

302
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,560
products but it's not the product as you

303
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,120
say so yeah that's brilliant okay so

304
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,560
coming to the next slide then you've

305
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
turned off this one panes obviously so i

306
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,079
believe we've just kind of touched on

307
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,240
this uh but what are the pains for like

308
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,680
you say your target audience at the

309
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,120
moment

310
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,880
uh yes so i

311
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,120
also started to

312
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,760
discuss the pains uh but the main

313
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,519
actually pain is how to proceed with

314
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,040
operations right when you go to every

315
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,800
scale for example you had gnosis safe to

316
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,600
govern your operations in ethereum and

317
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,959
you just

318
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,200
look for the singular stuff

319
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,000
and

320
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,880
like

321
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,440
you have these four options firstly you

322
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,760
can revive the existing multisig wallet

323
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,560
right

324
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,079
and try to

325
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,120
somehow operate under it with all its

326
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,760
obscurity and limitations maybe it is

327
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,560
possible it's like doing accounting in

328
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,880
google spreadsheets right so it is

329
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,200
possible but it is uh not that

330
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,279
convenient i guess

331
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,680
then they could implement their in-house

332
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,800
solution for barely the same

333
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,680
and

334
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,320
in this case it would be also okay

335
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,360
but

336
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,079
they would need to spend money and

337
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,480
would need to spend time to implement

338
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,839
this and the the biggest issue is that

339
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,160
their code will not be

340
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,959
open source right it will be an in-house

341
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,079
solution

342
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,199
uh

343
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,920
that means it won't be audited and

344
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,959
that's this means that possibly it could

345
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,720
be prone to errors or maybe some

346
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,240
like hacker attacks and so on so they

347
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,120
will always run risk of losing their

348
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,839
money so i i guess

349
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,560
it's not that convenient to always live

350
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,920
in this risk

351
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,839
right

352
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,000
yeah risk is not convenient in that

353
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,839
sense

354
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,120
yeah and yeah and the third option is

355
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
that they can

356
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,240
calmly wait for somebody

357
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,800
some authority like

358
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,399
this metamask institutional for example

359
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,880
like the biggest one

360
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,240
implements something forever scale but i

361
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,120
guess unfortunately they would have to

362
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,040
wait for a bit while

363
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,079
yeah and

364
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,160
because because

365
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,920
like um

366
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,399
something very extraordinary should

367
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,360
happen

368
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,399
uh for these uh conservative providers

369
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,279
to actually on board every scale

370
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,320
uh the blockchain that is on the

371
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,199
300 384th

372
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,720
place right

373
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,360
so why would they

374
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,920
yeah so maybe they would but it will

375
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
require some time and

376
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,959
i i i have doubts that

377
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,680
even if they start doing this they also

378
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,839
will look uh

379
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,920
on the market for their comparable

380
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,560
solutions and they would just buy this

381
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,839
solution and adjust it

382
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,000
importantly obviously the technical kind

383
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,759
of aspects of everscale with where we're

384
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,440
at right now would that they are going

385
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,079
to require time for big integrators so

386
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,000
you know i completely understand what

387
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,480
you mean there

388
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,720
uh yeah and like the fourth is yes as i

389
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,839
have mentioned is to find an alternative

390
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,639
and

391
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,959
like uh

392
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,920
a month ago i stumbled upon

393
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,959
the alternatives and

394
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,199
maybe that's why

395
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:09,920
i

396
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,240
started to were working on these

397
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,560
projects so that uh

398
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,959
if you know any good alternatives around

399
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,079
uh please let me know

400
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,399
it sounds like you're definitely uh

401
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,160
developing something which uh there is a

402
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,399
need for on ebay from as far as i can

403
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,120
see

404
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,600
uh so this next slide kind of moves us

405
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,399
into uh more of the overall market side

406
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,320
of things uh so i don't know if you want

407
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,800
to quickly walk us through this one

408
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,360
uh yeah so um

409
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,880
the idea uh for this slide was

410
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,880
actually if we have this bare minimum in

411
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,079
the

412
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,120
existing solutions right and

413
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,519
what if we just implement this bare

414
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,399
minimum and sit and wait for the

415
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,079
like uh companies to start going to

416
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,839
every scale for their operational

417
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,319
activity right sounds like a good plan

418
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,439
but actually not because these b2b

419
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,720
vendors

420
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,439
do not sit on their ass and they also

421
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,480
evolve

422
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,240
and the whole defy

423
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,240
and land and landscape evolves so that

424
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,160
they develop new and new methods of

425
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,799
working with financials like it is

426
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,679
firstly it was like farming it was

427
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,480
a

428
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,919
liquidity providing things then it was

429
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,960
like marginal uh farming then it was

430
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,200
like this nft

431
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,400
and cross chain uh farming then there

432
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,039
were bridges then there are different

433
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,760
kinds of product holes different kinds

434
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,200
of networks and people get confused

435
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
people get confused and they would like

436
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,679
some professionals to manage their money

437
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,360
instead

438
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,559
because they do not want to like

439
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,400
continuously

440
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,520
be fed by more and more information and

441
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,240
because they get lost so they would like

442
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,880
to have kind of professional brokers it

443
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,400
is a reflection of the mutual funds in

444
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,440
the

445
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,240
uh

446
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,919
in our real life uh so yes people go

447
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:20,799
there

448
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,679
they uh lend their money for the

449
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,760
interest and uh

450
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,600
of course brokers get their percent from

451
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,039
this money for their operations so uh

452
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,679
from what i see uh

453
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,480
from communications with agnosis team i

454
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,559
recently had communications they are

455
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,799
starting to build a new team which

456
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,000
actually focuses on just precisely that

457
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,799
so they have this gnosis safe which is

458
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,320
the b2b tool and they want to

459
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,840
make it work for

460
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,880
for the

461
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,080
normal users for the private accounts

462
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,039
uh and another thing is this super doll

463
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,480
thing uh

464
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,120
they raised 1 million

465
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,960
she drowned with

466
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,919
like lots of funds but still

467
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,600
it means that

468
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,720
this

469
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,640
topic of actually making joint decisions

470
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,039
and creating dao

471
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,600
using smart contracts is a vibrant

472
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,200
currently among people so that they

473
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,440
easily can

474
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,880
like

475
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,440
get investments and on the one hand and

476
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,160
succeed in implementing the solutions

477
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,120
that

478
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,000
users require on that

479
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
okay yeah of course so yeah yeah well

480
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,200
you've definitely done your homework

481
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,960
avenue my friend so that's always good

482
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,000
to see

483
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,640
okay so uh we're gonna talk uh a bit

484
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,000
about the uh

485
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,520
future of fido safe but if you just want

486
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,880
to very quickly uh take us through this

487
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,039
uh yeah

488
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,240
so

489
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,799
i see it as two steps as i mentioned on

490
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,000
my forum thread and the first step would

491
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,559
be to actually implement this bare

492
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,120
minimum with transactions users and

493
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,039
settings so that

494
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,120
every business

495
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,280
which wants to start their operations on

496
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,640
every scale can start doing this with a

497
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,919
either safe

498
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,360
and

499
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,880
the step two would be to somehow evolve

500
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,159
it to

501
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,640
make it a dao

502
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,720
where people can

503
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,640
profit from these and b2b tools right so

504
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,799
as i have said uh

505
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,000
i see it as a system where

506
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,039
everything is transparent you can

507
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,799
see how much money you want to land

508
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,919
and you can see how

509
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,600
how much money

510
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,559
you will get after some period of course

511
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,880
your money will be

512
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,840
blocked

513
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,880
for some time i guess it would be

514
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,159
something like in real life when we have

515
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,520
uh

516
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,039
only quarterly payments uh right so or

517
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,440
one per quarter

518
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,520
and

519
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,159
and also uh

520
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,480
the smart contracts can

521
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,360
give the transparency in terms of

522
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,880
how much money actually these brokers

523
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,240
have earned

524
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,000
and if it is reasonable to stick to them

525
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
continue sticking to them or maybe

526
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,520
switching to somebody else like finding

527
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,320
another company or firm with some better

528
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,840
stats

529
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,080
financial stats

530
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,159
okay so yeah excellent uh very very

531
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,400
comprehensive slideshow there buddy um

532
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,760
so thank you very much for putting that

533
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,520
together and sharing it with us

534
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,000
uh so let's like say let's uh take this

535
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,640
a little more informally now um so i

536
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,039
just want to know um just to start uh a

537
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,039
little more about your background uh so

538
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,159
you say you're you're you're a developer

539
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,919
uh not really

540
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,559
oh okay sorry i must have misinterpreted

541
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,760
that

542
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,280
yeah i i guess i would say that

543
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,400
i'm a kind of entrepreneur

544
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,440
and

545
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,320
what i like to do is to actually create

546
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,400
new value so uh

547
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,200
i

548
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,159
had

549
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,320
a history of a few startups

550
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,520
and

551
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,799
some of them were

552
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,400
this so that

553
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,000
successful

554
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,240
at least i had attraction on some of

555
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,600
them but maybe did some mistakes so that

556
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,360
i cannot

557
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
like bargain about something

558
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,559
uh very familiar that

559
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,600
you are all aware of

560
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,000
how uh the only real failure in life is

561
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,039
not trying again so yes yeah big flavor

562
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,760
in that so great stuff so what were some

563
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,520
of these startups you had uh can you

564
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,039
give us an idea of some of these things

565
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,919
i would like not to reveal it sorry no

566
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,679
no no no i don't know you don't have to

567
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,280
tell us the exact product names but what

568
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,039
areas were you working in

569
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,559
so what type of style a uh i t were they

570
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,120
i mean okay

571
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,919
funny enough

572
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,520
they were all b2b services actually so

573
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,919
so that yes it is my

574
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,760
primary target i understand that it is

575
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,840
harder to get b2b accounts

576
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,200
yes but

577
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,559
as soon as you acquire them it is easy

578
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,919
to in terms of like financials in terms

579
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,720
of statistics in terms of everything in

580
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,520
terms of churn yes

581
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,080
i've worked in uh several sales kind of

582
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,919
uh positions in my past and obviously b

583
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,320
to b there's a much much longer pipeline

584
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,440
uh with you know onboarding but then

585
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,679
when customers are on board uh you know

586
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,679
there's uh a much more professional

587
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,440
relationship there of course

588
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,600
uh so yeah that's brilliant uh so just

589
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
just to kind of refine that uh was it

590
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,679
mostly kind of software as a service uh

591
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,360
side of things or

592
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,400
yeah yeah

593
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,960
yeah so you were mostly in the b to b

594
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,799
s-a-a-s

595
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,400
and that that's an acronym and a half

596
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,679
isn't it because

597
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,159
the b-to-b to c-s-a-a-s

598
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,520
uh area

599
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,919
great stuff and so uh with this project

600
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,080
uh have you got a team with you or are

601
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,760
you working on your own are you

602
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,720
outsourcing uh parts of the project

603
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,880
how's it working there

604
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,880
yet currently i work on my own so yes i

605
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
do some coding but

606
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,279
i cannot call myself a developer because

607
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,559
actually i

608
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,440
do not have technical education right in

609
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,679
computer science and

610
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,000
of course i have a breadth of experience

611
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,159
of coding but do not for example have

612
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,000
an experience of

613
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,120
corporate coding so that coding in team

614
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,840
and

615
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,360
all this stuff

616
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,000
yes so uh

617
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,720
one of the reasons also to start this

618
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,520
product was to get acquainted with the

619
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,559
blockchain and the technology and uh

620
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,760
understand how the smart contracts work

621
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,720
on

622
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,520
every scale and yes

623
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,640
and it was a kind of a learning curve

624
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,679
for me

625
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,360
yeah it's a learning curve for everyone

626
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,760
around here i think i'm still learning

627
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,240
every day

628
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,799
sorry

629
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,640
i can code and like you can see from the

630
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,880
repository that yeah

631
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,919
every line of code was written by me so

632
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,039
yeah

633
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,720
if you want to

634
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,000
spot any uh like refinements please let

635
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,880
me know yeah okay excellent excellent so

636
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,720
if ever all your code is out there in

637
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,320
open source so everyone can have a look

638
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,159
yeah that's great to know

639
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,640
okay so that kind of i mean one quick

640
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,880
following question from that uh you say

641
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,159
learning how long have you been in this

642
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,440
space

643
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,520
uh in cryptocurrency

644
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
just out of interest

645
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,279
in crypto

646
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,520
not that long

647
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,039
i guess

648
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,799
from you know the

649
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,799
the the last i guess uh spike

650
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,720
maybe from uh

651
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,279
the beginning of this year

652
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,360
okay so i guess somewhere there in

653
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,440
january i hopped

654
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,360
into this market

655
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,159
because everything grew

656
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,400
yeah i wish i'd have entered the markets

657
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,880
in january i tell you

658
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,480
that's fantastic

659
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,960
okay and so uh regarding fido safe then

660
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,279
in kind of cold hard details about the

661
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,520
product uh what have you achieved so far

662
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,039
with the product is it a fully

663
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,080
functioning you know it's ready to go

664
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,480
you know where are you at in kind of the

665
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,760
mvp roadmap side of things

666
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,080
[Music]

667
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,919
uh

668
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,799
yeah

669
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,000
this

670
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,640
bare minimum

671
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,880
functionality actually

672
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,399
has like this

673
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,320
management transaction management to

674
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,200
user management session management and

675
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,960
also like sending some value

676
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,000
and

677
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,720
the question of sending value is not

678
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,600
that

679
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,440
is not ready yet but it is an easy thing

680
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,600
to implement so

681
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,080
with onboarding of this feature i would

682
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,120
say that i will have this bare minimum

683
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,399
mvp uh of course uh some bells and

684
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,679
whistles

685
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,320
need to be added for example some like

686
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,200
validation checks some

687
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,240
notifications about some removal and so

688
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,320
on of course

689
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,120
that users like and developers do not

690
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,360
like to implement

691
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,159
but

692
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,799
yes i think that in the nutshell

693
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,600
everything is ready besides the

694
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,520
transaction uh

695
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,320
transfer transaction itself okay

696
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
excellent excellent

697
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,279
and apart from the uh kind of items

698
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,679
you've just mentioned there then um like

699
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,360
you say with the transfer transaction

700
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,039
and those kind of extra bells and

701
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,679
whistles uh what are your immediate

702
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,080
plans so in terms of the media we're

703
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,880
kind of talking the next uh one two

704
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,930
three months maybe

705
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:40,069
[Music]

706
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,039
i would say

707
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,600
yeah so on boarding that kind of thing

708
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,360
i would say yes that it would

709
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,840
would not uh

710
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
get

711
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,559
into heavily into the development but

712
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,520
rather

713
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,399
i would start trying to communicate with

714
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,520
these companies who actually use this

715
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,480
software in different other blockchains

716
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,880
and will try to attract them to every

717
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,399
scale

718
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,279
so

719
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,640
but but for this of course i would need

720
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,000
this

721
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,480
software to

722
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,880
adhere to this

723
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,000
basic basic

724
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,760
requirements that

725
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,919
they would need and firstly is their

726
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,840
security right so

727
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,039
what i would need firstly once all their

728
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,960
code is ready is to

729
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,559
accomplish a number of code audits

730
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,679
and also publish them and

731
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,039
be able to run some campaign among the

732
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,679
community to

733
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,880
encourage

734
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,360
uh reporting bugs if people see them

735
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,840
okay excellent so uh just to kind of

736
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,080
reiterate that again for uh people are a

737
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,760
little slower on the technical side like

738
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,799
me

739
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,840
obviously the everscale incubator is

740
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,760
in its immediate plans looking for

741
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,279
projects to list onto dap radar quite

742
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,640
specifically

743
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,679
uh would you say that uh fido safe is

744
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,159
90 ready to be there like you say once

745
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,760
it's had the audits and the transfer

746
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,080
function added

747
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,679
uh yes but

748
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,679
you must understand that it takes time

749
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,679
right

750
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,919
okay

751
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,559
i know uh soon is uh everyone's favorite

752
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,279
word in uh everscale and well me in all

753
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,200
blockchain projects uh but if you had to

754
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,440
put a timeline to this again assuming

755
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,679
the best case scenario with this

756
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,240
uh okay okay let's divide the things

757
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,360
into

758
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,120
like technical

759
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,279
thing implementation right development

760
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,679
and verification

761
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,880
stage right and in terms of uh technical

762
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,320
completion i guess we are like

763
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,840
no longer than a month away from the

764
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,440
publication

765
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,120
and

766
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,640
in terms of the technicals we'd be

767
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,880
looking yeah okay sorry i'm muttering to

768
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,039
myself but carry on

769
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,200
uh yeah and in terms of

770
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,039
like

771
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,679
adoption and reviews and

772
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,640
some kind of

773
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,200
input from the users

774
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,320
i would say it will also require some

775
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,480
time and of course it depends on the

776
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,240
community so that i

777
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,159
would rely on the feedback from the

778
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,480
community yeah of course they're the the

779
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,840
feedback loop

780
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,039
that's brilliant

781
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,960
okay excellent excellent

782
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,600
and so i mean we're getting through my

783
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,360
questions very very efficiently buddy

784
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,679
yeah you're very good at this uh in

785
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,519
terms of what would you say are going to

786
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,080
be the biggest hurdles to you guys so uh

787
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,360
so what's going to be the biggest

788
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,240
potential road blocks or stoppers in

789
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,060
your path

790
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,080
[Music]

791
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,440
i guess

792
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,120
the biggest limiting factor is time of

793
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,840
course because i have like nine

794
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,760
to five job

795
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,399
and it could have some deadlines

796
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,640
okay i have family

797
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,159
uh to

798
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,880
manage and this also

799
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,480
means that i'm a kind of vulnerable

800
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,519
right because i can turn to something

801
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,799
else and

802
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,600
can

803
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,919
won't be able to devote

804
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,080
much time to this

805
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,279
product

806
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,919
by actually

807
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,519
refocusing on

808
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,760
my work or my family

809
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,960
etc so that i guess

810
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,559
this would be the biggest risk as

811
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,799
as in solo

812
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,679
founder startups in general

813
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,519
and yes the best way to handle it is

814
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,519
to actually

815
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,200
maybe uh share the vision of the next

816
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,799
steps and build up a team who can also

817
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,320
help

818
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,279
okay so that leads quite nicely into

819
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,279
what exactly are you looking to uh get

820
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,080
from uh everscale incubator what help

821
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,320
and support do you really need to take

822
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,960
this forward

823
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,320
uh

824
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,159
so yeah uh

825
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,120
like

826
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,600
initially i would

827
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,440
love to have

828
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,120
uh this uh

829
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,919
problem with security solved

830
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,760
so that if it

831
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,960
requires

832
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,000
some effort from the community members

833
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,240
and it would be great if it requires

834
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,279
some costs to perform these audits

835
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,240
then

836
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,240
also okay but i would like the community

837
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,799
to help me with collecting

838
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,919
the

839
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,840
the the necessary money right okay so

840
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,519
accomplish this

841
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,600
yeah so first and foremost in your

842
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,200
immediate kind of plans you would need

843
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,440
uh some kind of help in terms of you

844
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,199
know the auditing costs involved in

845
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,879
making sure this is

846
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,639
you know where it needs to be at in

847
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,560
terms of security

848
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,440
yeah

849
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,879
okay yeah

850
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,560
and the second would be to actually

851
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,280
guarantee to the first users first

852
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,560
commercial users that this software

853
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,560
works as intended so that i would also

854
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,800
like to have the beta testers program

855
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,359
where people can try it and report

856
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,079
whatever they find so for this i guess i

857
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,440
would need some

858
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,560
pr

859
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,280
to

860
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,879
make my product noticed among the people

861
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,280
who actually may need it

862
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,239
and

863
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,599
be able to maybe

864
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,480
like

865
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,800
ping me around and

866
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,920
join my

867
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,720
say a telegram channel or something like

868
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,160
that so that they can also contribute

869
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,640
with their ideas with their

870
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,520
features and so on

871
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,400
in terms of the everscale community

872
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,760
you're speaking to the right man on that

873
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,280
i'm sure i can help you out as much as

874
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,280
possible with that uh when we go forward

875
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,240
if if go forward uh excellent

876
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,359
uh so yeah so we've got auditing costs

877
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,920
uh beta testing programs uh these are

878
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,680
both the areas you'd need support is

879
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,400
there anything else

880
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,280
immediate

881
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,640
yeah for them indeed i guess yes

882
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,520
for the long-term goals i also would

883
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,599
like to have kind of this pr support

884
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,240
maybe some copyrights

885
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,359
with help with articles and

886
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,560
publication into forums and catalogues

887
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,640
if it is possible

888
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,400
yeah and maybe

889
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,359
maybe some help with the communicating

890
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,280
with some external entities uh when

891
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,839
trying to actually

892
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,680
helping them get started with this new

893
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,960
blockchain

894
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,920
and ultimately ultimately of course when

895
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,880
we have a kind of plan for the next

896
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,140
steps it would be great to also

897
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,839
[Music]

898
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,560
have a help about

899
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,359
tim building but of course it is like

900
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,240
currently on all the horizon

901
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,119
not not the short-term goal yeah of

902
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,440
course so yeah i mean it sounds like

903
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,640
you've got a quite a solid plan in place

904
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,359
um well let's go into the speculative

905
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,400
side of things uh assuming that uh you

906
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,480
know uh everything goes through and well

907
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
with evscale incubator

908
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,119
and uh you get and receive all the help

909
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,800
you need in the short term

910
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,200
uh let's let's put a rough days on it uh

911
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,839
where would you see the products being

912
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,240
in terms of usage uh you know um

913
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,200
uh

914
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,359
consumer customer figures that kind of

915
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,079
thing say uh one year from now and then

916
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,839
three years from now what what would be

917
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,240
your kind of very optimistic outlook for

918
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,599
this

919
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,640
well not very optimistic but you're uh

920
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,560
i don't want to put one yeah don't worry

921
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,880
if you sound too uh sunshine and

922
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,640
lollipops but you know your

923
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,839
realistically best case scenario

924
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:26,720
okay

925
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,280
okay uh i i guess uh

926
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,920
that even if we like

927
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,440
liter

928
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,960
even one

929
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,000
company you must understand that

930
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,400
their operational

931
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,240
volumes are

932
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,640
starting from one million dollars so

933
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,400
that it would be

934
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,520
success

935
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,680
i think to me at least

936
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,119
to have even one corporate client that

937
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,760
uses this software on the day-to-day

938
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,720
basis

939
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,839
uh like for example if they're

940
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,320
if their volume is like

941
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,680
for example this one million dollar uh

942
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,960
then the transactional costs would be

943
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,599
i guess uh like in the

944
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,800
in the

945
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,960
year uh

946
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,760
calculation it would be a kind of a few

947
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,170
a few

948
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,640
[Music]

949
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,040
tens of thousands

950
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,839
of dollars so that

951
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,599
even this i would

952
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,640
kind of

953
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,320
cover some some budget for

954
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,800
for bread and butter right

955
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,640
yeah yes

956
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,079
toe the bread line as they say

957
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,960
okay so uh what one kind of

958
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,000
stickler problem i i could see possibly

959
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,320
um obviously you say you need help with

960
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,680
auditing and beta testing and such

961
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,119
would there be any insurance liability

962
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,599
accountability issues here uh because

963
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,400
obviously as i kind of understand it a

964
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,280
big part of the institutional need here

965
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,480
is

966
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,960
for that calpability

967
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,720
they don't want to be responsible for

968
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,440
their own keys and own coins almost

969
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,400
of course

970
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,560
i i guess nobody in crypto is

971
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,760
responsible for anything and like

972
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,839
every time you use

973
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,520
some product it has a big disclaimer

974
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,920
right that we are not responsible for

975
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,880
anything and please do your own research

976
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,560
right man

977
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,160
so i i guess

978
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,359
for these tools it is also

979
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:38,880
be the truth

980
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,800
because um

981
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,920
um

982
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,200
in the majority of cases in the similar

983
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,359
products and the

984
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,480
completed code audits are basically

985
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,800
enough to say that

986
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
the solution is secure

987
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,240
and like then users are invited to have

988
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,040
their own research if they want but all

989
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,319
the risks are actually on their

990
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,079
part

991
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,040
okay and obviously cryptocurrency is and

992
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,880
uh well that part on the pumbaa is an

993
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,960
ever-changing regulatory landscape

994
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,599
uh like i said do you see any issues

995
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,400
with this at all coming up or what have

996
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,240
you already kind of done your homework

997
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,400
and covered your bases in

998
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,560
terms of the legal due diligence side

999
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
no i didn't

1000
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,319
and

1001
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,920
what i see here

1002
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,200
is of course

1003
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,400
it is a regulated activity and

1004
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,880
the entities which

1005
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,319
do these kind of brokership operations

1006
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,520
they require some kind of certificates

1007
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,000
of course some kind of they are under

1008
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,839
some

1009
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,440
regulations definitely

1010
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,400
and

1011
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,760
these regulations uh normally lie

1012
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,400
outside of the software they use

1013
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,720
so for example yeah they need to

1014
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,359
kind of brokership license they need

1015
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,280
some uh docs right to keep crypto to

1016
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,000
like sell and buy crypto but this

1017
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,200
doesn't uh have any connection to the

1018
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,520
software they use for performing their

1019
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,720
operations

1020
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,359
yes at least on the surface and uh

1021
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,800
hopefully

1022
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,720
yeah so yeah of course a little more

1023
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,200
deep digging required just in case but

1024
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,560
uh given your knowledge of the landscape

1025
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
uh this this is

1026
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,400
i mean it falls down to individual

1027
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,560
liability essentially

1028
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,200
so yeah okay brilliant uh so what i

1029
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
think we're going to do norton is we're

1030
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,720
just going to take a very quick

1031
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,119
two-minute break i'm going to refill my

1032
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,680
coffee and we're going to see if anyone

1033
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,800
in the group has any questions for you

1034
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,160
uh let me just find out i've got too

1035
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,079
many telegram groups where's this one

1036
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,359
gone

1037
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,839
uh incubator here we go

1038
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,920
so

1039
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,839
uh did you do any questions

1040
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,839
all right so i don't know if you want to

1041

guys

1051

as far as i can see no no questions in

1053
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,200
the group uh as of yet so

1054
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,119

1055
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,359

slightly more frivolous style of hosting
