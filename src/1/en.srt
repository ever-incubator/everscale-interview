1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:08,200
Ok so, hello everyone listening, this is 
obviously Everscale incubator. I belive we're 
on show number one.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm speaking today with Norton who is bringing 
his project to us, Fidosafe

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,500
So hi Norton. Good to have you here! Would 
you introduce yourself?

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,400
Yes, sure, Ben, thanks for providing the 
stage

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,300
for presenting my project, actually cannot

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,200
say much about myself, like I'm ordinary 
guy

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,100
developer, crypto enthusiast, and, yes, I'm 
like

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,000
keeping an eye on the Everscale blockchain

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,900
for a while, but did not have a chance to

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,800
find applicable cases that I can implement

11
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,700
but, yes, recently I've found a niche

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,600
that sounds interesting to me, and today 
I would like to

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,500
say a few words about this niche, describe 
the target

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,400
audience, its pains, its needs, and share

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,300
some insights, and, actually, like it

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,200
was the grounds for, this project,

17
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,100
Fidosafe, that I'll also maybe share

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,000
during this broadcast. Ok, well, in this 
case

19
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,900
I think we should probably dive straight 
into it and

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,800
... doing a screensharing

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,700


22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,600
aha, yes.

23
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,500
so can everyone see that pitch there on the 
screen if I've shared the right screen?

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,400
Yes, I guess the wrong screen, it is a website 
page

25
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,300
Wrong screen? Yeaw. Here we go. Yes. Go to... 
We've got the infinite loop, I apologise 
guys.

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,200
let's close that down. More used to working 
with

27
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,100
Zoom, yeah. Yes, me too, that's why I didn't 
want to share.

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,000
there we go. so. can everyone see the pich?

29
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,900
We should see Fidosafe

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,800
on the screen. Yeah, I do.

31
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,700
Ok, excellent. Let's just quickly roll through 
this

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,600
We won't going through every point on the 
document, as I've got a few questions, I'll 
try to keep it

33
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,500
a little more informal, but yeah, obviously, 
if you could give us just

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,400
a very quick high-level interview of what 
is Fidosafe.

35
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,300
Hm, ok, just to warm up

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,200
I would like to say a few words about the 
name, so the name originates from

37
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,100
actually Latin, and Fido means the first 
person

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,000
verb, like "I trust",

39
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,900
like the safe that I trust, Fidosafe, but 
recently

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,800
somebody shared a reference that there is 
a famous player

41
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,700
chess player, Vladimir Fidoseev, and yes,

42
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,600
from that time, when I hear Fidosafe, I think 
about chess.

43
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,500
This is a very hot topic with the World Championship

44
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,400
of course. Yeah, uh. But basically in a nutshell

45
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,300
this is a service, webservice where

46
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,200
actually people can jointly

47
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,100
manage their financial resources, so that 
we would have

48
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,000
multiple custodians using different wallets 
who can sign transactions

49
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,900
and perform some operations as community

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,800
as DAO, yeah.

51
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,700
Touching into your first point, who is this 
product aimed at?

52
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,600
who is going to use Fidosafe?

53
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,500
Yeah,it might

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,400
sound surprising

55
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,300
that there are some B2B tools around on the 
market

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,200
so not only personal accounts in crypto nowadays 
but also business

57
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,100
accounts start start penetrating the crypto 
surface

58
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,000
more and more, and of course market starts 
preparing

59
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,900
some tools for catering to these accounts. 
THat's why I can describe

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,800
these companies as small

61
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,700
crypto investment firms, or maybe crypto

62
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,600
brockers, and possibly communities who also 
come together

63
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,500
to make financial decisions together, other

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,400
audiences for the shared using are of

65
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,300
the accounts are for example are miners or 
exchanges, but they are I guess too big to

66
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,200
fit the Fidosafe requirements

67
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,100
so that I would just

68
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,000
limit the users to

69
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,900
small and medium crypto businesses theat 
we will call crypto funds

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,800
or crypto firms. Ok, so essentially blockchain

71
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,700
centric small and medium enterprises and 
businesses which have to

72
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:05,600
follow more formal path. Yeah. And so, again, 
this is a very nicely laid out slide presentation, 
what is it that there is a need

73
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,500
that will why they are ready products that 
use these people

74
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,400


75
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,300
There are the tools, and the tools serve 
actually the existing blockchains

76
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,200
if one of these companies

77
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,100
would like to start their operations on Everscale, 
then they would need to

78
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,000
to uh

79
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,900
adjust to also continue

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,800
operations from here, and they could have 
different options

81
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,700
for this

82
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,600


83
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,500
that's ok, I've thought someone bombing, 
now all good

84
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,400
as you say, this is the solution which

85
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,300
already exist on the chains in the forms, 
but there is

86
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,200
obiously... I'll let you explain aside this 
slide yourself if you want, existing solutions

87
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,100
so yes,

88
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,000
to prepare to this presentation I checked 
the market

89
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,900
and tried to find the tools that people use

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,800
and tried to investigate which functionality 
is built into these

91
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,700
tools, so that here is my list that originated 
from

92
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,600
maybe two hours of searching

93
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,500
of course there are more solutions on the 
market, but these are the

94
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,400
prominent ones, and basing on the

95
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,300
solutions I can make some assumptions on 
what these businesses should require

96
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,200
and the functionality of these solutions 
is actually

97
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,100
is pretty much the same, so that if we go

98
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,000
to maybe the second slide

99
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,900
that could help us, we will find out that

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,800
in the bare minimum it will require three

101
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,700
things actually. First: some tools for collective

102
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,600
decision making, so that multiple custodians 
can

103
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,500
vote for this or that or against this or 
that decision

104
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,400
then user management, the ability to assign 
roles

105
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,300
and to add more people, remove people from

106
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,200
the list of custodians,

107
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,100
I mean onboarding and offboarding employees 
actually

108
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,000
Sorry, I believe I've got the right temp 
here, we can kind say an exmple, so that 
this is actually

109
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,900
the product doing it here, I belive you've 
added

110
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,800
a custodian here as an example transaction 
you showed me earlier

111
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,700
Yes, we can see that happening, sorry, carry 
on...

112
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,600
... and the third maybe the most tricky

113
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,500
one is auditing facilities

114
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,400
the ability to see the historical

115
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,300
log and be able to understand who did what 
and when

116
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,200
and when I started with Everscale,

117
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,100
I tried a few multisig accounts

118
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,000
and actually, and none of them had

119
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,900
open source code, but there were compiled 
versions

120
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,800
of these multisig accounts, and using these 
accounts is

121
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,700
it was really tricky to understand the history 
of operations

122
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,600
maybe it was something wrong with me, but

123
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,500
I feel total obscurity, that was one of the 
reasons to actually

124
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,400
create something where the transactions are 
obvious

125
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,300
you can at every moment glance at a transaction 
and see

126
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,200
its details and who confirmed or rejected 
it

127
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,100
and what was inside this transaction, what 
operation should happen

128
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,000
so essentially just comming to this part 
of the slide

129
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,900
there are solutions

130
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,800
which kinda do the task that Fidosafe does, 
but you do it in more refined

131
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:56,100
manner which is more suitable for the target 
audience you're aiming for here

132
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,000
Right, actually it is a service, and not 
a wallet,

133
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,900
so that users are not obliged to

134
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,800
to come to this new wallet and operate only 
in this

135
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,700
wallet, comparing to, for example, Oberton

136
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,100
when you need to forcefully switch to this 
solution

137
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,000
for all your operations, but instead it is 
a webservice that uses different wallets

138
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,900
for a very-very concrete purpose

139
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,800
for signing multisig transactions and for 
managing multisig transactions, and for

140
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,700
managing the related operations, so, yes, 
on the one hand there are

141
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,600
wallets that can potentially implement the 
same

142
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,500
but it is not their specialization, they 
are busy with

143
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,400
other things like implementing DeBots, implementing 
trueNFTs

144
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,300
implementing other features, that their customers 
actually require

145
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,200
instead, why would they

146
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,100
turn to some other niche market and start 
doing something

147
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,000
different, it does not make sense. Yes of 
course, I understand that

148
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,900
completely, that makes a lot of sense, so 
obviously these

149
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,800
other solution providers it's an option, 
it's a feature

150
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,700
of these products, but it's not their product 
as you say.

151
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,600
Yeah, that's brilliant. Comming to the next 
slide, you've turned this one Pains, obviously,

152
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,500
so we're just going to touch on these, but 
what on the Pains like you say your target 
audience at the moment.

153
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,400
Yes, also started to

154
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,300
discuss the pains, but the main pain so actually 
how to

155
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,200
proceed with operations when you go to Everscale

156
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,100
for example, you had Gnosis to govern your 
operations

157
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,000
in Etherium, and you just look for the similar 
stuff

158
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,900
and you have these four options

159
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,800
Firstly, you can revive an existing multisig 
wallet

160
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,700
and try to somehow operate under it with

161
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,600
ll its obscurity and limitations, maybe it 
is possible, it is

162
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,500
like dooing accounting in Google Spreadsheets, 
so it is possible, but it

163
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,400
is not that convenient. Then they could

164
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,300
implement their in-house solution

165
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,200
and in this case it would be also ok, but 
they would need to spend money

166
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,100
and would need to spend time to implement 
this

167
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,000
and the biggest issue is that their code 
will not be open source

168
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,900
it will be an in-house solution

169
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,800
that means it won't be audited, this means 
it could be possibly prone to

170
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,700
errors or maybe some hacker attacks

171
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,600
so they will always run risk of losing their 
money

172
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,500
I guess it's not that convenient

173
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,400
to always live in this risk

174
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,300
Right, risk is not convenient in that sense

175
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,200
and the third option is that they can calml 
wait for somebody

176
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,100
some authority like Metamask Institutional

177
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,000
when the biggest vendor implements this

178
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,900
function for Everscale

179
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,800
but I guess that unfortunately they would 
have to wait for a bit while.

180
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,700
and because

181
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,600
something very extraordinary should happen

182
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,500
for these conservative providers to actually 
onboard

183
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,400
Everscale, the blockchain that is on the

184
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,300
three hundred and eighty fourth place?

185
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,200
why would they? maybe they would, but

186
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,100
it will require some time, and I have doubts 
that

187
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,000
even if they start doing this, they will 
also look on the market

188
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,900
for the comparable solutions

189
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,800
and they would just buy this solution and 
adjust it

190
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,700
Of course the technical aspect of Everscale 
with we're right now would that

191
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,600
they all gonna require time for beginning 
integration, so I completely understand what 
you mean

192
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,500
the 4th is

193
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,400
to find an alternative and

194
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,300
a month ago I stumbled upon

195
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,200
the alternatives, and maybe

196
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,100
that's why I started to working on this project

197
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,000
if you know any good alternatives around, 
please let me know

198
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,900
It sounds like you're definitely developing 
something which

199
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,800
there is a need for at Everscale firm as 
far as I can see

200
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,700
so this next slide kinda moves us into more 
of the overall market

201
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,600
side of things, I donno if you want to quickly 
walk us through this one?

202
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,500
Yes, so the idea for the this slide was

203
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,400
actually if we have this bere minimum

204
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,300
in the existing solutions, what if we

205
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,200
just implement this bare minimum and sit 
and wait for companies

206
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,100
to start going into Everscale for their operational 
activity?

207
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,000
Sounds like a good plan. But actually not 
because these B2B vendors

208
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,900
do not sit on their ass and they also evolve

209
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,800
and the whole defi

210
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,700
land and landscape evolves

211
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,600
so that they develop new and new of working 
with financial tools

212
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,500
firstly it was liquidity providing,

213
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,400
then it was marginal farming,

214
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,300
then it was this NFT and cross-chain farming

215
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,200
there were bridges, then there were diferent 
kinds of protocols

216
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,100
different kinds of networks, and people get 
confused

217
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,000
and they would like some professionals to 
manage their money

218
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,900
because they do not want

219
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,800
to continuesly be fed by more and more information

220
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,700
and because they get lost, so they want to 
have professional brockers

221
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,600
it is the reflection of the mutual funds

222
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,500
in our real life, so people, the lend their 
money

223
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,400
for the interest

224
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,300
and of course brockers get their percent 
from

225
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,200
this money for their operations, so from 
what I see

226
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:40,100
from the communication with the Gnosis team, 
I recently had the communication,

227
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,000
the are starting to build the new team which 
actually focuses on just precisely that

228
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,900
so they have this Gnosis safe which is a 
B2B tool

229
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,800
and they want to make it work for

230
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,700
the normal users, for the private accounts

231
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,600
and another thing is SuperDAO

232
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,500
they raised one million dollars, seed round 
with lots of funds

233
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,400
but still it means that this topic

234
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,300
of actually making joint decisions and creating 
DAO

235
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,200
using smart contracts is vibrant currently

236
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,100
among people so that they easily can

237
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,000
get investments on the one hand and succeed

238
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,900
in implementing the solution that users require 
on the other

239
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,800
Yeah, of course, well, you've done your homework, 
always good to say

240
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,700
so we're gonna talk a bit about

241
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,600
the future of Fidosafe very quickly

242
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,500
so I see

243
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,400
two steps as I mentioned on my forum thread,

244
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,300
the first is to actually implement this bare 
minimum

245
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,200
with transactions, users and settings, so 
that every bussiness which wants to start

246
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,100
their operations on Everscale can start doing 
this

247
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,000
with Fidosafe, and step 2 would be to evolve,

248
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,900
to make it DAO

249
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,800
where people can profit from these B2B tools

250
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,700
I see it as

251
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,600
system where everything is transparent

252
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,500
you can see how much money you want to lend

253
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,400
you will see how much money you will get

254
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,300
after some period, of course your money will 
be blocked

255
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,200
for some time, I guess it would be something

256
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:07,100
like in real life, when we have only quartely 
payments

257
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,000
one per quarter and also

258
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,900
this smart contract can

259
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,800
give the transparency

260
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,700
in terms of how much money these brockers 
have earned

261
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,600
and if it is reasonable to stick to them

262
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,500
or maybe switching to somebody else, like 
finding another

263
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,400
company or a firm with better stats.

264
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,300
Excellent, thanks, very comprehensive slides

265
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,200
Thank you very much for putting it together 
and sharing it with us

266
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,100
Let's take it a little more informally

267
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,000
I just wannt know a little more about your 
background

268
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,900
so you say you're a developer? Not really

269
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,800
So I must have misinterpreted that.

270
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,700
I would say that I'm an enterpreneur,

271
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,600
and what I like to do it actually create

272
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,500
new value, so I had a history of

273
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,400
a few startups, and some of them were

274
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,300
this or that successful

275
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,200
at least I had tracktion on some of them

276
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,100
but maybe did some mistakes so that cannot

277
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,000
bragging about something very familiar that 
you are all aware of

278
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,900
The only really failure in life is not trying

279
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,800
again so... Yes. So waht were these startups?

280
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,700
Can you give us an idea about these things?

281
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,600
Ah...

282
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,500
I would like not to reveal it, sorry. Oh, 
no, you don't have to tell what the exact 
product,

283
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,400
but what areas you were working in? What 
type of startups? It?

284
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,300
Ok,

285
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,200
Funny enough, they were all B2B services, 
so that it is my

286
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,100
primary target, I understand

287
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,000
that it is harder to get B2B accounts

288
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,900
but as soon as you acquire them, it is easier 
in

289
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,800
terms of financials, in terms of statistics, 
in terms of

290
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,700
everything, in terms of churn especially. 
yeah!

291
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,600
I've worked in a several sales positions 
in my past, and obviously B2B

292
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,500
is a much longer pipeline with onboarding, 
but

293
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,400
when customers are onboarded, there is much 
more professional relationship

294
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,300
so yeah, that's brilliant. Just to kinda 
verify that.. was it mostly kind of software 
as a service, sort of things or?

295
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,200
Yeah,

296
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,100
So you're mostly in a B2B SaaS.

297
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,000
B2B2C SaaS

298
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,900
and so with this project

299
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,800
have you got a team with you, or you're working 
on your own? You're outsourcing?

300
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,700
How is it working there?

301
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,600
Yeah, currently I work on my own.

302
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,500
but I cannot call myself a developer because 
actually I

303
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,400
don't have technical education in Computer 
Science

304
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,300
of course I have a great deal of experience 
in coding, but

305
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,200
do not have an experience of corporate coding

306
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:12,100
so that coding in team and this stuff and

307
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,000
one of the reasons also to start this product 
was to

308
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,900
get acquainted with the blockchain and the 
technology

309
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,800
and understand how the smart contracts work 
on Everscale and

310
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,700
it was a kinda learning curve

311
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,600
for me, and the learning curve, so yes, the 
learning curve for everyone around here I 
think, I'm still learning every day

312
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,500
Sorry,

313
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,400
Yeah, I can code, and you can see from

314
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,300
the repository that yeah, every line of code 
was written by me

315
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,200
if you want to spot any refinements

316
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,100
please let me know

317
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,000
Excellent, so all your code is in open source, 
so everyone can have a look at it. Yeah. 
That's great to know.

318
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,900
One quick follow-up question from that:

319
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,800
you say "learning", how long have you been 
in the space?

320
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,700
in crypto currency? just out of interest. 
in crypto, not that long,

321
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,600
I guess from

322
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,500
You know, the last spike

323
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,400
Maybe from the beginning of this year.

324
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,300
Somewhere there in January I hopped into 
this market

325
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,200
because everything grew.

326
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:50,100
I wish I'de went in the market in January 
I told you. That is fantastic.

327
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,000
So regarding Fidosafe, about cold-heart details

328
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,900
about the product, what have you achieved 
so far, is it a fully-functioning?

329
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,800
Is it ready to go? Where you are at in kinda

330
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,700
MVP roadmap sort of things?

331
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,600
this bare minimum functionality

332
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,500
has this management

333
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,400
transaction management, user management, 
session management

334
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,300
and also sending value

335
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,200
and the question of sending value is not 
ready yet

336
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:39,100
so with onboarding of this feature

337
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,000
I would say that I would have this bare minimum 
MVP

338
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,900
or course some bells and whistles need to 
be added

339
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,800
for example validation checks, notifications

340
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,700
about removal and so on

341
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,600
of course users like and developers do not 
like to implement

342
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,500
but I think in the nutshell

343
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,400
everything is ready besides the transfer 
transaction itself

344
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,300
Excellent. Apart from items you've just mentioned,

345
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,200
like you say with the transfer transaction

346
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:28,100
and all these bells and whistles

347
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,000
what are your immediate plans

348
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,900
in terms of one-two-three months

349
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,800
I would say

350
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,700
... onboarding that kind of thing.

351
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,600
I would say that it would not get into

352
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,500
havily into the development

353
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,400
but rather

354
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,300
I would start trying to communicate with 
these companies how actually use

355
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,200
this software in different other blockchains 
and will try to attract them to Everscale

356
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,100
but for this I would need

357
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,000
this software to adhere to basic requirements

358
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,900
that they will need, and firstly is the security

359
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,800
what I would need

360
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,700
once all the code is ready

361
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,600
it to accomplish a number of code audits

362
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,500
and also publish them and be able to

363
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,400
run some campaign among the community to

364
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,300
encourage reporting bugs

365
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,200
if people see them

366
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,100
Excellent. Just to kinda re-iterate for a 
people who are really slow on technical side 
like me, obviously Everscale incubator

367
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,000
it has immediate plans looking for projects 
to list on DappRadar specifically

368
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,900
would you say

369
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,800
that Fidosafe is 90% ready?

370
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,700
once it has the audits and the transfer function 
added?

371
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,600
Yes, but you must understand that it takes 
time

372
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,500
Soon is everyone's favorite word

373
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,400
In Everscale and blockchain projects

374
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,300
but if you put a timeline to this again assuming 
the best case with this?

375
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,200
Ok, let's divide the things into technical 
-

376
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:55,100
implementation, development and verification

377
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,000
and in terms of technical completion I guess

378
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,900
we're no longer than a month away from the 
publication

379
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,800
in terms of the technicals

380
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,700
we'd be looking, yeah, I'm mustoring to myself, 
but don't worry, carry on

381
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,600


382
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,500
and in terms of adoption and reviews

383
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,400
and some kind of input from the users, I 
would say it will also require some time

384
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,300
and of course it depends on the community

385
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,200
so that I would rely on the feedback from 
the community

386
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,100
Yeah, of course feedback loop, that's brilliant. 
And so,

387
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,000
We're getting through my questions very and 
very efficiently, but you're very good at 
this

388
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,900
What would you say gonna be the biggest hurdles, 
so what's gonna

389
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,800
be the biggest potential road blocks, stops 
in your path?

390
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,700


391
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,600
I guess the biggest limiting factor is time 
of course

392
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,500
because I have 9-to-5 job

393
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,400
and it could have some deadlines, I have 
family

394
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,300
to manage, and this also means that I'm kind 
of

395
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,200
vulnerable because I can turn to something 
else

396
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,100
and won't be able to devote much time

397
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,000
to this product by refocusing on

398
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,900
my work, home, my family, etc., so

399
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,800
that I guess this would be the biggest risk

400
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,700
as in solo-founder startups

401
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,600
in general, and the best way to handle it 
is

402
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:02,500
to maybe share

403
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,400
the vision of the next steps and build up 
a team who can also help

404
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,300
Ok, that leads quite nicely, so what exactly 
are you

405
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:17,200
looking to get from the Everscale incubator

406
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,100
what help and support do you really need 
to take this forward

407
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,000
Initially

408
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,900
I would love to have

409
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,800
this problem with the security solved, so 
that

410
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,700
if it requires some effort from the community 
members

411
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,600
it would be great as it requires some

412
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,500
costs to perform these audits

413
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,400
also ok, but I would like the community to 
help me with collecting the

414
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,300
necessary money to accomplish this

415
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,200
so first and foremost in your immediate kinda 
plan you need some kind of helpie

416
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,100
in terms of auditing costs involved

417
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,000
to be where it needs to be in terms of security. 
Yes.

418
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,900
the second would be to actually

419
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,800
guarantee to the first users, first commercial 
users

420
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:30,700
that this software works as intended, so 
that I would also like

421
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,600
to have the beta testers program

422
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:40,500
where people can try it and report whatever 
they find

423
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,400
for this I would need some PR

424
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,300
to make my product noticed among the people 
who actually

425
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,200
may need it and be able to

426
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:00,100
ping me around and join my

427
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,000
Telegram channel or something like that so 
that they can also contribute

428
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,900
with their ideas, with their features

429
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,800
in terms of the Everscale community

430
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,700
you're speaking with the right man, sure 
I can help you out as much as possible with 
that if we go forward

431
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,600
Excellent, so we've got auditing costs, beta 
testing programs,

432
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,500
these are both the areas where you need support, 
is there anything else?

433
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,400
Again, immediate.

434
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,300
For immediate I guess yes, for the long-term 
goals I also

435
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,200
would like to have

436
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,100
this PR support, maybe copywriters help with

437
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,000
articles and publications to forums and catalogs

438
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,900
and maybe

439
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,800
some help with communicating with some external 
entities

440
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,700
whe trying to helping get started

441
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,600
with this new blockchain

442
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,500
and ultimately when we have a plan for

443
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,400
the next steps, it would be great to also 
have a help about team building

444
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:28,300
but of course it is currently

445
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,200
only on the horizon

446
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,100
not the shirt-term goal. Yes, of course, 
it sounds like you've got quite a solid plan 
in place

447
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,000
let's go to the speculative side of things

448
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,900
assuming that everything goes through and 
well with the Everscale incubator

449
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,800
and you receive all the help you need in 
the shirt term

450
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,700
let's put a rough date on it, where would 
you see

451
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,600
the product in terms of usage

452
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,500
consumer customer figures that kind of things

453
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,400
one year from now and three years from now, 
what would be your very optimistic outlook 
for this?

454
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,300
not very optimistic but yours

455
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,200
I don't wanna you to sound too sunshining 
you know, your realistically

456
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,100
best-case scenario

457
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,000
Ok, I guess that even if we

458
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,900
lure even one company

459
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,800
you must understand that their operational 
volumes

460
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:46,700
are starting from one million dollars, so 
that

461
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,600
it would be success to me at least

462
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,500
to have even one corporate client that uses 
this software on the day-to-day basis

463
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,400
if their volume is like

464
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,300
this 1 mln dollars

465
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,200
than the transactional costs would be

466
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:16,100
in a year

467
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,000
calculation it would be a few

468
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,900
tens of thousands dollars

469
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,800
even this would cover some

470
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,700
budget for bread and butter

471
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,600
yeah

472
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:45,500
ok, one kind of

473
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,400
stickler problem I could see possibly, so 
you'd need

474
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,300
help with auditing and beta testing and such, 
would there be any

475
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,200
insurance liability, accountability issues 
here because obviously as

476
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:05,100
I understand it's the big part of the institutional 
need is

477
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,000
that for this accountability, they don't 
wanna be responsible for

478
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:14,900
their own keys and own coins. of course,

479
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,800
I guess nobody in crypto is responsible for 
anything

480
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,700
and every time you use a product, it has 
a big

481
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,600
disclaimer that "We are not responsible for 
anything"

482
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,500
and please do your own research, so I guess 
for these

483
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,400
these tools it is also be the truth

484
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,300
because in the majority of cases

485
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,200
in the similar products the completed code 
audits

486
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:54,100
are basically enough to say that the solution 
is secure

487
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:59,000
and then users are invited to have their 
own research

488
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,900
but all the risks are actually on them

489
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,800
ok, and obviously the crypto currency is

490
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,700
ever-changing regulatory landscape

491
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,600
do you see any issues with it at all coming 
up?

492
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,500
have you already done your homework in

493
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,400
terms of legal due dilligent side?

494
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,300
No, I didn't, and what I see here

495
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,200
it is of course a regulated activity

496
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:43,100
and the entities which do these kind of

497
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,000
brockership operations, they require some 
kind of certificates

498
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:52,900
they are unders some regulations, definitely

499
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,800
but these regulations normally lie

500
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,700
outside of the software they use, for example

501
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,600
they need to have a brockership license, 
they need some docs

502
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,500
to keep crypto, to sell and buy crypto, but 
this doesn't

503
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,400
have any connection to the software they 
use for performing

504
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:22,300
their operations at least on the surface, 
hopefully

505
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,200
Yes, of course a little more deepdigging 
required just in case

506
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,100
but given your knowledge of the landscape 
this is

507
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,000
forced down to individual liabilities actually

508
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,900
Brilliant, so what we're gonna do, Norton, 
is we just gonna take

509
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,800
a very quick two-minute break

510
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,700
I'm gonna refill my coffee, and we're gonna 
see if anyone in the group has any questions 
for you

511
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,600
let me just find, too many Telegram groups 
out there

512
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,500
Incubator, so...

513
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,400
any questions?

514
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:11,300
right, so don't know if you wanna grab yourself 
a very quick drink, I just gonna go get my 
coffee up, and we

515
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,200
come back and see if anyone in the group 
has any questions and see if any more pop 
up into my little head

516
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:21,100
In two minutes, right? Yes, just a couple 
of minutes. Brilliant, speak to you in a 
moment.

517
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,000


518
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,900


519
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,800
I've got my coffee filled up, guys, I think...

520
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,700
As far as I can see no questions in the group 
as of yet, so

521
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,600
I believe it was a pretty comprehensive run 
through today, yeah, anything you'd like 
to add?

522
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:50,500
Oh, I'm really excited about your questions

523
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,400
and I think we've covered everything that 
I wanted

524
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,300
Thank you very much for this deep and detailed 
interview, you were great, Ben, thanks.

525
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,200
Thank you.

526
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,100
I'm sure you know I used to do slightly frivolous 
style of hosting

527
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,000
it's been nice having you in a more serious 
conversation

528
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:19,900
which is good to expand, it's been a brilliant 
meeting, Norton,

529
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,800
and I'm very excited to find out how your 
progect progresses

530
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,700
you have a great rest of your day, thank 
you for listending a lot

531
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,900
have a great day
